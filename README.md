# WeatherQuest

## Inspiration
I have seen a lot of weather app and website but a lot of them has very boring UI and sometimes show complex information. So, I designed a simple website, that will immediately show the temperature and weather condition once you type the city name. The unique thing about WeatherQuest is that it has a video game theme UI and there is an animation for each weather condition, inspired by IPhone weather app where you can see rain falling and clouds moving. I choose not to use boring icon like other website and draw each animation by hand.

## What it does
The website will immediately show the temperature and weather condition once you type the city name. Each weather condition is shown by retro video game style animation. To make it realistic, each animation can change depending on day or night time of the city.

## How I built it
The weather information is retrieved from Visual Crossing API. All the front-end weather animations are were handdrawn with pixel art, and the animations were done by looping two images at a time by using javascript. The website is run by node.js.
